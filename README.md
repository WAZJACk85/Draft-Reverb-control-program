# Draft-Reverb-control-program

This Read me will display the updates to the main project,







Current information:-

The current file is a very brief sketch of an app designed to monitor inputs of reverb control of a reverb sythsesiser to an amp or head or pedal.



Caveat:-

Once the program has taken on a very high level of complexity and becomes viable to bring to market, I will not post further changes on here and will potentially remove some code and insert comments and end comment with how many lines of code are missing.
