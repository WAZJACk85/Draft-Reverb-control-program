# Draft-Reverb-control-program

This Read me will display the updates to the main project,

# Currently updating code, I have just pasted in latest Iteration, however this is only me looking at the code for about 10 minutes, I realised that I had , a) possibly lost some save updates, or b) intended to include an altered version. Anyway this is more up to date now, but next week will be a fully working console program.



Current information:-

The current file is a very brief sketch of an app designed to monitor inputs of reverb control of a reverb sythsesiser to an amp or head or pedal.

I will update new components each week from 15/09/2021.   Once the program reaches a certain intellectual value, I will leave read me files with the title of the original file and these can be described and annotated in interview with the assistance of pre-prepared videos/files I can share on the Teams/Zoom interview video call.

Caveat:-

Once the program has taken on a very high level of complexity and becomes viable to bring to market, I will not post further changes on here and will potentially remove some code and insert comments and end comment with how many lines of code are missing.
